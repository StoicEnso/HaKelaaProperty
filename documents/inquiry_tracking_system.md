Subject: Re: Ha. Kelaa Property Investment Opportunity

Dear [Name],

Thank you for your interest in our Ha. Kelaa property investment opportunity. We appreciate your inquiry and are excited to provide you with more information.

The property is a prime 4,326.73 sq. ft. plot located just 3-4 minutes from the beach in Ha. Kelaa, perfectly positioned for guest house development. As you may be aware, the Maldives government recently designated 325.5 hectares in the Kelaa lagoon for two major resort developments (Presidential Decree No. 07/2025), making this an excellent time to invest in the area.

I've attached our detailed investment presentation which includes:
- Complete property specifications and location details
- Market analysis of the Maldives tourism sector
- Information about the upcoming resort developments in Ha. Kelaa
- Various lease options (50-year, 75-year, and 99-year terms)
- Projected ROI analysis

Would you be available for a call to discuss this opportunity in more detail? Please let me know your preferred date and time, and we can arrange a discussion.

In the meantime, if you have any specific questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

Best regards,
White Cowrie Co. Pvt. Ltd.
